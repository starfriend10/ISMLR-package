# ISMLR-package

We published a paper that used ISMLR package to predict future influent wastewater flowrate:

Jun-Jie Zhu, & Paul R. Anderson. (2019). Performance evaluation of the ISMLR package for predicting the next day's influent wastewater flowrate at Kirie WRP. Water Sci. Technol. wst2019309. doi: https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2019.309


ISMLR package version includes data preprocessing tools and the ISMLR application.

Data preprocessing tools include:

• Outlier detection

• Periodogram analysis, and 

• Time-series dataset generation

The ISMLR application can:

• Select a subset of important regressors

• Minimize the amount of missing data from a regression analysis

• Provide prediction of the response regressor, or

• Produce pretreated datasets for a subsequent prediction using a more advanced algorithm
